# XRPL Introduction

This application uses xrpl.js to showcase how to interact with the XRPL.

The goal is to complete different functions in:

- `src/transactions`
- `src/wallets.ts`
- `src/client.ts`
- `src/index.ts` (main file to call all the functions)

to then interact with the XRPL and see the results in the [explorer](https://testnet.xrpl.org/).
